### Data Modeling with AWS Redshift for Song Play Analysis

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database
and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3,
in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory
with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

Sparkify wants to build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3,
stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for
their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users
are listening to.

The following fact and dimension tables for a star schema have been defined
to optimize the queries for analysis:

**Fact Table**

1. `songplays` - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records
with page `NextSong`

  *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id,
  session_id, location, user_agent*

**Dimension Tables**

1. `users` - users in the app

  *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*

2. `songs` - songs in music database

  *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*

3. `artists` - artists in music database

  *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*

4. `time` - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units

  *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*

#### Data

Two datasets reside in S3:

- Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
- Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

Log data json path: `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`

**Song Dataset**

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the
[Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/).
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of
that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's
track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file,TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json,
looks like.

```JSON
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

**Log Dataset**

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this
[event simulator](http://millionsongdataset.com/)
based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from
an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year
and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

#### Files

`create_table.py` creates fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift.

`etl.py` loads data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process
that data into analytics tables on Redshift.

`sql_queries.py` defines SQL statements, which will be imported into
the two other files above.

`dwh.cfg` AWS Redshift datawarehouse credentials.

#### Usage

Once a Redshift cluster has been created, on the command line run:

```python
> python create_tables.py
> python etl.py
```

Check Query Editor to verify table creation and loading of data.
